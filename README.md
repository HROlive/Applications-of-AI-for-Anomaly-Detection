## Description

Whether your organization needs to monitor cybersecurity threats, fraudulent financial transactions, product defects, or equipment health, artificial intelligence can help catch data abnormalities before they impact your business. AI models can be trained and deployed to automatically analyze datasets, define “normal behavior,” and identify breaches in patterns quickly and effectively. These models can then be used to predict future anomalies. With massive amounts of data available across industries and subtle distinctions between normal and abnormal patterns, it’s critical that organizations use AI to quickly detect anomalies that pose a threat.

In this workshop, we learned how to identify anomalies and failures in time-series data, estimate the remaining useful life of the corresponding parts, and map anomalies to failure conditions. More specifically, how to prepare time-series data for AI model training, develop an XGBoost ensemble tree model, build a deep learning model using a long short-term memory (LSTM) network, and create an autoencoder that detects anomalies for predictive maintenance. At the end of the workshop, we are able to use AI to estimate the condition of equipment and predict when maintenance should be performed.

## Information

The overall goals of this course were the following:
> - Prepare data and build, train, and evaluate models using XGBoost, autoencoders, and GANs;
> - Detect anomalies in datasets with both labeled and unlabeled data;
> - Classify anomalies into multiple categories regardless of whether the original data was labeled.

More detailed information and links for the course can be found on the [course website](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/training/instructor-led-workshops/anomaly-detection/).
